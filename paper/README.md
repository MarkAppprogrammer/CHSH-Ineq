## Research Paper (WIP)

**Abstract**:
Entanglement is the cornerstone of quantum computation and is essential in quantum algorithms. Generating long-range and high-quality entanglement is a necessary milestone for current hardware to reach. We attempt to quantify the quality of entanglement on a quantum computer for distant qubits using ClauserHorne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality violations. This is done through simulations on a full circuit noise model using distances ranging from $2$ to $12$.
