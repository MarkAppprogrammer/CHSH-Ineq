# CHSH-Ineq
Research project on the CHSH inequality

Member Names: Seaena Kim, Adam Jurkowski, Mark Agib

After cloning the repo run
```pip install requirments.txt```
so we can all have the same libraries installed

*Note: So that we don't write over each other make pull requests instead of a direct commit to the main branch.*

All of the code has an associated `README.md` for documentation purposes and [`code/nisq-entaglment/code.ipynb`](code/nisq-entaglment/code.ipynb) has some more markdown for explanations of specfic descions.

Some prelim results. Noisy simulation with noise model from `ibm_brisbane` with diffrent phases for entanglemnt 6 qubits away from each other:

## Research
**(Working) Research Question**: How can the CHSH parameter be used to measure the quality of entanglement on distant qubits based on noisy simulations of quantum computers?
